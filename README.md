# Dumpling

Dumpling is a framework using which you can publish issues/articles as apps easily by connecting with the Magnet API or using the zip files created by Linechef.

The framework lets you get an issue's details in 2 ways

1. Parse through a zip file for an issue (in the application bundle)
2. Get an issue id (or an individual article's id) and retrieve the information from Magnet

Dumpling has been written with Swift 1.2 and is very easy to use and integrate. This short guide is to help you understand the usage of Dumpling in your projects and the methods available to you with the framework.

## Dependencies

1. The Dumpling framework looks for **AFNetworking** libraries for making calls to the Magnet API. AFNetworking is included as a part of the framework

2. Dumpling uses Realm as the database. The Realm library and headers are included directly inside the framework so publishers do not have to include it separately

3. Dumpling uses ZipArchive for unarchiving zip files. The ZipArchive .a and header file are included in the project


## VolumeHandler

This is the main class and the starting point of Dumpling

###Properties
1. **issueHandler** ```IssueHandler``` An instance of IssueHandler class - this uses the same folder and client key as the VolumeHandler


###Methods
1. **init(folder: NSString)** Initializes the VolumeHander with the given folder. This is where the database and assets will be saved

    **NOTE:** The initializer requires a Client key. If you wish to pass a client key to the initializer, use one of the below initializers. This method will look for a ```String``` with the key ```ClientKey``` in your project's **Info.plist**
```
<key>ClientKey</key>
<string>Your Key Here</string>
```

2. **init(clientkey: NSString)** Initializes the VolumeHandler with the Documents directory. This is where the database and assets will be saved. The key is used for making calls to the Magnet API

3. **init(folder: NSString, clientkey: NSString)** Initializes the VolumeHandler with a custom directory. This is where the database and assets will be saved. The key is your Client API key provided by 29.io

4. **getCurrentSchemaVersion()** ```returns UInt``` Find current schema version

## Notifications

Dumpling issues notifications at various stages of a download. This information can be used by apps to update progress and app data. The notifications issued by Dumpling include

1. **issueDownloadComplete** This notification is fired when an issue's data is downloaded from Magnet and saved back to the database. The articles and assets might still be downloading at this stage

2. **articlesDownloadComplete** This notification is fired when the data for all articles in an issue are downloaded and saved back to the database. It is not necessary that all assets have been downloaded at this point

3. **downloadComplete** This notification is fired when everthing related to a volume or an independent issue or article is downloaded (issues, articles, assets)

4. **allDownloadsComplete** This notification is fired when all articles/volumes added via the respective ArticleHandler/VolumeHandler methods are downloaded completely


## Usage

```
//For zipped files
let appleId = "org.bomb.mag.issue.20150101"

var docPaths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSSearchPathDirectory.DocumentDirectory, NSSearchPathDomainMask.UserDomainMask, true)
var docsDir: NSString = docPaths[0] as! NSString
        
var volumeHandler = VolumeHandler(folder: docsDir)

//This nil check is needed. The initializer might return a nil if it doesn't find 
//"ClientKey" in Info.plist
if volumeHandler != nil {
	//Issue from a ZIP
    volumeHandler.issueHandler.addIssueZip(appleId)

    //For volumes from API
    volumeHandler.addVolumeFromAPI("555a27de352c7d6d5b888c3e") //The volume's global id
}
```


## Additional notes

1. If you wish to publish your issue on Newsstand, make sure your project's plist has the *UINewsstandApp* key with a *true* value. You will also need to add NewsstandKit.framework to your project

2. In order to use iCloud for syncing reading status, add CloudKit.framework to your project, turn on iCloud in the target's *Capabilities* section for *Key-value storage*. The sample project (**DumplingDemo**) uses the default container for storing and retrieving values. If you wish to use a custom container, the code will change accordingly

3. If you turn on App Groups for multiple projects and instantiate **IssueHandler**, **VolumeHandler** and **ArticleHandler** with the appropriate shared folder, you can read the data across multiple apps. To do this, you will need an app id with *App Groups* enabled and set the app group in *Capabilities* for all projects sharing the data


#Purchases

## PurchaseHandler

This is a class for handling purchases (retrieving and adding)

###Methods
1. **init(folder: NSString)** Initializes the PurchaseHandler with the given folder. This is where the database exists

    **NOTE:** The initializer requires a Client key. If you wish to pass a client key to the initializer, use one of the below initializers. This method will look for a ```String``` with the key ```ClientKey``` in your project's **Info.plist**
```
<key>ClientKey</key>
<string>Your Key Here</string>
```

2. **init(clientkey: NSString)** Initializes the PurchaseHandler with the Documents directory. This is where the database exists

3. **init(folder: NSString, clientkey: NSString)** Initializes the PurchaseHandler with a custom directory. This is where the database exists. The key is your Client API key provided by 29.io


    **NOTE:** The Client key is not used as of now by the PurchaseHandler but might be in the future.

4. **addPurchase(purchase: Purchase)** This method adds a purchase to the database

5. **getPurchases(userId: String?)** ```returns Array<Purchase> or nil``` The method returns an array of purchases made on this device - for a specific user or all purchases (if userId is nil)

6. **getPurchasesFor(key: String, value: String, userId: String?)** ```returns Array<Purchase> or nil``` This method accepts a Purchase's key and value for purchase search. It retrieves all purchases which meet these conditions and returns them in an array. The key and value are needed. userId is optional

7. **getPurchase(purchase: Purchase)** ```returns Volume, Issue, Article or nil``` This method accepts a purchase object and returns the associated article, issue or volume object


## AccessControl

This is a protocol for managing access control to various purchases. The client app will implement this

###Methods
1. **purchaseItem(object: AnyObject)** This method makes an in-app purchase and calls the Subscriber API to verify if the purchase receipt is valid or not. If valid, the content is unlocked and made available to the user

2. **restorePurchases(userId: AnyObject?)** This method restores all in-app purchases for the current logged in user. If any issues purchased are not available, they will be downloaded, saved to the database and made available. This method checks both in-app purchases as well as web purchases (if userId is not nil)

3. **restoreWebPurchases(userId: AnyObject)** This method retrieves all web purchases for the user whose id is passed. If any issues purchased are not available, they will be downloaded, saved to the database and made available

4. **isAvailable(appleId: String, userId: AnyObject?)** ```returns Bool``` This method checks if a user has access to a given issue (based on Apple id/SKU). If the userId is provided, the app will check for access permissions through both in-app purchase and web purchases. Otherwise it will only check against in-app purchases

5. **listPurchases(userId: AnyObject?)** ```returns Array<String> or nil``` This method returns an array of skus for Purchases made by the current logged in user (or IAPs + web purchases if userId is not nil)

6. **syncPurchases(userId: AnyObject)** This method syncs all purchases saved in the database to the server for given user identity. All purchases which do not have a user id (i.e. have been purchased on the device through IAPs) will also be marked as purchased by this user on the server


##Sample Implementation
A sample implementation of in-app purchases is provided in the demo. For the purpose of this demo, we are assuming all products purchased are **Articles**.

The classes of interest for the IAP implementation are

1. **PurchasesViewController.swift** This class is where the IAP product info is loaded and listed in a table view. When you select a row, it will add the row's product id to the payment queue. On successful verification of the purchase, you will be taken to ```PurchaseDetailViewController```

    a. **getProductInfo()** In this method make sure you replace the sample product ids with actual product ids for your in-app purchases
    
    b. **restorePurchases(sender:)** This method has commented calls for various methods provided in the AccessControl class

2. **PurchaseDetailViewController.swift** This class downloads a purchased article and adds it to the database by creating a ```Purchase``` class object

3. **AccessControlDemo.swift** This class is the implementation of the AccessControl protocol. It also implements the ```SKPaymentTransactionObserver``` method

4. **NetworkManager.swift** This class is used for handling all network calls to the subscriber API (used mostly by the ```AccessControlDemo``` class)

    a. The **baseURL** used in the ```init()``` method will change. Right now it is pointing to the test server
    
    b. The **secretKey** used to generate the header is hard-coded for now to test against the staging server. This will change in the final implementation. 29.io will provide the secretKey
    

###To-dos for getting the demo to work

1. Set the correct team under **General** tab of the target and change the bundle identifier

2. Under **Capabilities** tab for the target, turn on **In-app purchases**

3. Replace the **ClientKey** in the Info.plist with your client key

4. Replace the **SharedSecret** in the Info.plist with your Apple in-app purchases Shared Secret generated in **itunesconnect.apple.com**

5. In the **PurchasesViewController**, change the product identifiers in the ```getProductInfo()``` method
