# Dumpling

Dumpling is a framework using which you can publish issues/articles as apps easily by connecting with the Magnet API or using the zip files created by Linechef.

The framework lets you get an issue's details in 2 ways

1. Parse through a zip file for an issue (in the application bundle)
2. Get an issue id (or an individual article's id) and retrieve the information from Magnet

Dumpling has been written with Swift 1.2 and is very easy to use and integrate. This short guide is to help you understand the usage of Dumpling in your projects and the methods available to you with the framework.

## Dependencies

1. The Dumpling framework looks for **AFNetworking** libraries for making calls to the Magnet API. AFNetworking is included as a part of the framework

2. Dumpling uses Realm as the database. The Realm library and headers are included directly inside the framework so publishers do not have to include it separately

3. Dumpling uses ZipArchive for unarchiving zip files. The ZipArchive .a and header file are included in the project


## VolumeHandler

This is the main class and the starting point of Dumpling

###Properties
1. **issueHandler** ```IssueHandler``` An instance of IssueHandler class - this uses the same folder and client key as the VolumeHandler


###Methods
1. **init(folder: NSString)** Initializes the VolumeHander with the given folder. This is where the database and assets will be saved

    **NOTE:** The initializer requires a Client key. If you wish to pass a client key to the initializer, use one of the below initializers. This method will look for a ```String``` with the key ```ClientKey``` in your project's **Info.plist**
```
<key>ClientKey</key>
<string>Your Key Here</string>
```

2. **init(clientkey: NSString)** Initializes the VolumeHandler with the Documents directory. This is where the database and assets will be saved. The key is used for making calls to the Magnet API

3. **init(folder: NSString, clientkey: NSString)** Initializes the VolumeHandler with a custom directory. This is where the database and assets will be saved. The key is your Client API key provided by 29.io

4. **getCurrentSchemaVersion()** ```returns UInt``` Find current schema version

5. **addVolumeFromAPI(globalId: NSString)** The method uses the global id of a volume, gets its content from the Magnet API and adds it to the database

6. **getVolume(volumeId: String)** ```returns Volume or nil``` Get volume details from database for a specific global id

7. **listVolumes()** The method is for testing only. It prints the available volumes for a client api key

8. **addAllVolumes()** This method gets all the volumes for a given client key and adds them to the database


## IssueHandler

This class handles adding issues to the database. If using a VolumeHandler, you do not need to initialize IssueHandler and can use the instance provided by VolumeHandler

###Methods
1. **init(folder: NSString)** Initializes the IssueHandler with the given folder. This is where the database and assets will be saved

    **NOTE:** The initializer requires a Client key. If you wish to pass a client key to the initializer, use one of the below initializers. This method will look for a ```String``` with the key ```ClientKey``` in your project's **Info.plist**
```
<key>ClientKey</key>
<string>Your Key Here</string>
```

2. **init(clientkey: NSString)** Initializes the IssueHandler with the Documents directory. This is where the database and assets will be saved. The key is used for making calls to the Magnet API

3. **init(folder: NSString, clientkey: NSString)** Initializes the IssueHandler with a custom directory. This is where the database and assets will be saved. The key is your Client API key provided by 29.io

4. **addIssueZip(appleId: NSString)** The method uses an Apple id, gets a zip file from the project Bundle with the name appleId.zip, extracts its contents and adds the issue, articles and assets to the database

5. **addIssueFromAPI(issueId: String, volumeId: String)** The method uses the global id of an issue, gets its content from the Magnet API and adds it to the database. The volume id is optional and if provided, saves the global id of the volume this issue is associated with

6. **listIssues()** The method is for testing only. It prints the available issues for a client api key

7. **searchIssueFor(appleId: String)** ```returns Issue or nil``` The method searches for an issue with a specific Apple ID. If the issue is not available in the database, the issue will be downloaded from the Magnet API and added to the DB

8. **getIssue(issueId: NSString)** ```returns Issue or nil``` Get issue details from database for a specific global id

9. **addIssueOnNewsstand(issueId: String)** Add issue on Newsstand

10. **getActiveDownloads()** ```returns NSArray``` Get issue ids whose download not complete yet


## ArticleHandler

This class created for managing independent articles

###Methods
1. **init(folder: NSString)** Initializes the ArticleHandler with the given folder. This is where the database and assets will be saved

    **NOTE:** The initializer requires a Client key. If you wish to pass a client key to the initializer, use one of the below initializers. This method will look for a ```String``` with the key ```ClientKey``` in your project's **Info.plist**
```
<key>ClientKey</key>
<string>Your Key Here</string>
```

2. **init(clientkey: NSString)** Initializes the ArticleHandler with the Documents directory. This is where the database and assets will be saved. The key is used for making calls to the Magnet API

3. **init(folder: NSString, clientkey: NSString)** Initializes the ArticleHandler with a custom directory. This is where the database and assets will be saved. The key is your Client API key provided by 29.io

4. **addArticleFromAPI(globalId: String)** The method uses the global id of an article, gets its content from the Magnet API and adds it to the database as an independent article

5. **addAllArticles()** Gets all the articles for a client key from the API and adds it to the database

7. **getAllArticles(page: Int, count: Int)** ```returns Array<Article> or nil``` The method returns a paginated list of independent articles from the database. If you need all articles, specify count as 0. The page index starts at 0

## Notifications

Dumpling issues notifications at various stages of a download. This information can be used by apps to update progress and app data. The notifications issued by Dumpling include

1. **issueDownloadComplete** This notification is fired when an issue's data is downloaded from Magnet and saved back to the database. The articles and assets might still be downloading at this stage

2. **articlesDownloadComplete** This notification is fired when the data for all articles in an issue are downloaded and saved back to the database. It is not necessary that all assets have been downloaded at this point

3. **downloadComplete** This notification is fired when everthing related to a volume or an independent issue is downloaded (issues, articles, assets)


## Usage

```
//For zipped files
let appleId = "org.bomb.mag.issue.20150101"

var docPaths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSSearchPathDirectory.DocumentDirectory, NSSearchPathDomainMask.UserDomainMask, true)
var docsDir: NSString = docPaths[0] as! NSString
        
var volumeHandler = VolumeHandler(folder: docsDir)

//This nil check is needed. The initializer might return a nil if it doesn't find 
//"ClientKey" in Info.plist
if volumeHandler != nil {
	//Issue from a ZIP
    volumeHandler.issueHandler.addIssueZip(appleId)

    //For volumes from API
    volumeHandler.addVolumeFromAPI("555a27de352c7d6d5b888c3e") //The volume's global id
}
```


## Additional notes

1. If you wish to publish your issue on Newsstand, make sure your project's plist has the *UINewsstandApp* key with a *true* value. You will also need to add NewsstandKit.framework to your project

2. In order to use iCloud for syncing reading status, add CloudKit.framework to your project, turn on iCloud in the target's *Capabilities* section for *Key-value storage*. The sample project (**DumplingDemo**) uses the default container for storing and retrieving values. If you wish to use a custom container, the code will change accordingly

3. If you turn on App Groups for multiple projects and instantiate **IssueHandler**, **VolumeHandler** and **ArticleHandler** with the appropriate shared folder, you can read the data across multiple apps. To do this, you will need an app id with *App Groups* enabled and set the app group in *Capabilities* for all projects sharing the data
